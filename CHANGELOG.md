# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-22

Second hotfix for the "offline mode is enabled" crash on model load. 0.4.4 reverted the inference-path offline guards but kept the same trap on the load path, so users who updated to 0.4.4 kept hitting the exact error the release was supposed to fix ([#526](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/526)). This release removes the load-path guards and patches the transformers tokenizer load to be robust to HuggingFace metadata failures at the source, so the class of bug can't recur.

### Reliability

- **Load no longer fails with "offline mode is enabled"** ([#530](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/530), fixes [#526](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/526)). transformers 4.57.x added an unconditional `huggingface_hub.model_info()` call inside `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` (via `_patch_mistral_regex`) that runs for every non-local repo load, regardless of cache state or whether the target model is actually a Mistral variant. The load-time `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` guard from 0.4.2 turned that into a hard crash for cached online users the moment 0.4.4 removed the inference-path guard that had been masking the problem. Fix wraps `_patch_mistral_regex` so any exception from the HF metadata check is caught and the tokenizer is returned unchanged — matching the success-path behavior for non-Mistral repos. The wrapper installs at `backend.backends` import time so it covers Qwen Base, Qwen CustomVoice, TADA, and every other transformers-backed engine on Windows, Linux, and CUDA alike. The load-time `force_offline_if_cached` guards were removed — with the wrapper in place they provide zero value and only risk re-introducing the same failure mode.
- **No more 30s pause when generating without a network.** The HuggingFace metadata timeout called out as a known caveat in 0.4.4 is covered by the same patch; offline users no longer wait for the check to time out before load completes.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-21

Hotfix for a regression in 0.4.3 where generation and transcription could fail outright with "offline mode is enabled" even when the user was online.

### Reliability

- **Inference no longer fails with "offline mode is enabled" while online** ([#524](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/524), reverts the inference-path guards from [#503](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/503)). 0.4.3 wrapped every inference body (`generate`, `transcribe`, `create_voice_clone_prompt`) with a process-wide `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` flip to stop lazy HuggingFace lookups from hanging when the network drops mid-inference ([#462](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/462)). That flag also blocks legitimate metadata calls (e.g. `HfApi().model_info` for revision resolution) so online users started seeing generation fail outright. Inference now runs with the process's default HF state. Load-time offline guards — which weren't the source of the regression — stay in place.

**Known caveat**: users generating without an internet connection may see brief pauses during inference while HuggingFace metadata lookups time out (typically ~30s, after which the library recovers). A proper offline-mode toggle is planned for 0.4.5.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-20

A patch focused on two user-impacting reliability fixes: macOS DMG notarization (unblocks `brew install voicebox` on macOS 15 Sequoia and fixes spurious "app isn't signed" Gatekeeper dialogs on older Intel Macs) and Kokoro Japanese voice initialization on fresh installs.

### macOS

- **DMGs are now notarized and stapled** ([#523](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/523)). Tauri's bundler notarizes the `.app` inside the DMG but ships the DMG wrapper itself unnotarized. Gatekeeper rejects that on macOS 15 Sequoia (confirmed by Homebrew Cask CI failing on both arm and intel Sequoia runners) and causes the "the app is not signed" dialog on older Intel Macs when Apple's notarization servers are slow or unreachable ([#509](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/509)). The release workflow now submits each DMG to `notarytool`, staples the ticket, verifies with `spctl`, and overwrites the draft-release asset `tauri-action` uploaded. Adds ~5-10 min per macOS job.

### Backend

- **Kokoro Japanese voices no longer crash on fresh installs** ([#521](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/521), fixes [#514](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/514)). `misaki[ja]` pulls in `fugashi`, which needs a MeCab dictionary on disk. The `unidic` package that was being installed ships no data and expects a ~526MB runtime download that `just setup` doesn't run (and which wouldn't survive PyInstaller anyway). Swapped to `unidic-lite`, which bundles a MeCab-compatible dict inside the wheel (~50MB). Collected in `build_binary.py` so frozen builds pick up `unidic_lite/dicdir/`.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-20

This release localizes the entire app. English, Simplified Chinese (zh-CN), Traditional Chinese (zh-TW), and Japanese (ja) are wired up end-to-end across every tab, modal, dialog, and toast — 559 translation keys per locale, parity verified. Plus a batch of reliability fixes: offline-mode now actually stays offline, Chatterbox accepts reference samples it used to reject, MLX Qwen 0.6B points at the right repo, and macOS system audio survives backgrounding.

### Internationalization ([#508](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/508))
- **i18next foundation** with an in-app language switcher that re-renders the tree on change — lazy-loaded components were holding stale strings without an explicit key-bump on the React root.
- **Four locales** at full coverage: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese. No partial/English-fallback surfaces.
- **Every user-visible surface translated**: Stories (list, content editor, dialogs, toasts), Effects (list, detail, chain editor, built-in preset names), Voices (table, search, inspector, Create/Edit modal, audio sample panels), Audio Channels (list, dialogs, device picker), history + story dropdown menus, ProfileCard / ProfileList / HistoryTable, and the unsupported-model note.
- **Relative dates** localize via `date-fns` locale objects (`3 days ago` → `3 天前` / `3 日前`) — `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` doesn't produce the phrasing we use in the history table.
- **Dev-build version suffix** (`v0.4.2 (dev)` / `(开发版)` / `(開發版)` / `(開発版)`) is now locale-aware.
- **559 translation keys** across all four locales.

### Reliability
- **`HF_HUB_OFFLINE` now guards every inference path** ([#503](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/503)) — some engines were still attempting a HuggingFace metadata roundtrip on first load when offline mode was enabled, causing hangs on airgapped or flaky networks.
- **Chatterbox reference samples are preprocessed instead of rejected** ([#502](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/502)) — samples outside the expected sample rate or channel layout are resampled to match, rather than failing with an opaque error.
- **MLX Qwen 0.6B repo path fixed** ([#501](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/501)) — now points at the published `mlx-community` repo so the model actually downloads on Apple Silicon.
- **macOS system audio survives backgrounding** ([#486](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/486), closes [#41](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/issues/41)) — WKWebView was tearing down the audio session when the app lost focus, silently killing system-audio capture.
- **MLX backend `miniaudio` dependency pinned** ([#506](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/506)) — `mlx_audio.stt` needs it at runtime and nothing else transitively pulled it in, so `--no-deps` installs were breaking on first use.

### Landing / Docs
- **New `/download` page** ([#487](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/487)) — no more dumping first-time visitors onto the GitHub releases list. The API example snippet on the landing page also got an accuracy pass.
- **Download redirects work behind reverse proxies** ([#498](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/498)) — uses the public origin instead of `localhost` when resolving platform-specific installer URLs.
- **MDX docs audited against the multi-engine backend** ([#484](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/484)) — stale single-engine assumptions removed.
- **Three more tutorials + mobile navbar / hero CTA fixes** ([#483](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/483)).

### Linux
- **Still not shipping.** The re-enable attempt ([#488](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/488)) landed on `main` but CI still hangs in the `tauri-action` bundler step on `ubuntu-22.04` — no output for 25+ minutes after `rpm` bundling, even with `createUpdaterArtifacts: false` and `--bundles deb,rpm`. The matrix entry is disabled again for 0.4.2; the ubuntu-specific setup steps stay in the workflow so re-enabling is a one-line change once we identify the hang. Next release will take another pass.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-18

A fast follow-up to 0.4.0 focused on making the new engines actually load in the production binary — plus generation cancellation, Linux system-audio capture, and the repo's first PR-time type check. Five first-time contributors shipped in this release.

0.4.0 introduced three new TTS engines, but the frozen PyInstaller binary tripped over several Python-ecosystem quirks that don't show up in the dev venv: `transformers` opening `.py` sources at runtime, `scipy.stats._distn_infrastructure` hitting a frozen-importer `NameError`, and `chatterbox-multilingual` failing to find its Chinese segmenter dictionary. This release patches all of those in one sweep.

### Frozen-Binary Reliability ([#438](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/438))
- **Kokoro** now bundles `.py` sources alongside `.pyc` via `--collect-all kokoro` so `transformers`' `_can_set_attn_implementation` regex scan can read them — previously `FileNotFoundError: kokoro/modules.py` killed Kokoro loading in production builds
- **Chatterbox Multilingual** now bundles `spacy_pkuseg/dicts/default.pkl` and the package's native `.so` extensions via `--collect-all spacy_pkuseg` — previously the Chinese word segmenter crashed with `FileNotFoundError` on first load
- **scipy.stats._distn_infrastructure** — new runtime hook source-patches the trailing `del obj` (which raises `NameError` under PyInstaller's frozen importer because the preceding list comprehension evaluates empty) to `globals().pop('obj', None)`, unblocking `librosa` → `scipy.signal` → `scipy.stats` for every TTS engine that depends on librosa
- **transformers.masking_utils** — same runtime hook forces `_is_torch_greater_or_equal_than_2_6 = False` so the older `sdpa_mask_older_torch` path is selected; the 2.6+ path uses `TransformGetItemToIndex()`, a real `torch._dynamo` graph transform our permissive stub can't reproduce
- **torch._dynamo** — no-op stub replaces the real module before `transformers` imports it, preventing the `torch._numpy._ufuncs` import crash (`NameError: name 'name' is not defined`) that blocked Kokoro and every engine pulling in `flex_attention`
- `.spec` paths are now repo-relative instead of absolute, so the generated spec is portable across machines and CI

### Generation
- **Cancel queued or running generations** ([#444](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/444)) — new `/generate/{id}/cancel` endpoint and a Stop button on the history row while generating. The serial queue now tracks per-ID state (queued / running / cancelled) so queued jobs are skipped before the worker picks them up and running jobs are `.cancel()`-ed mid-flight; `run_generation` catches `CancelledError` and marks the row `failed` with a "cancelled" error.
- **Legacy `data/` path prefix resolution** ([#440](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/440)) — generations stored with the old `data/` prefix under pre-0.4 installs now resolve correctly after the storage root moved, fixing 404s for historical audio.

### Model Migration
- Migration dialog no longer hangs when the cache is empty ([#439](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/439)) — the backend now emits a completion SSE event even when zero models are moved.
- Storage-change flow surfaces a toast when there's nothing to migrate ([#433](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/433)) instead of proceeding with a no-op move and restarting the server.
- Deleting all generations from a voice profile now deletes the associated version files and DB rows too ([#447](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/447)) — previously orphaned versions accumulated in storage.

### Platform
- **Linux system audio capture** ([#457](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/457)) — `cpal`'s ALSA backend doesn't expose PulseAudio/PipeWire monitor sources by name, so the previous device-name search never matched and silently fell back to the microphone. Detection now uses `pactl get-default-sink` + `pactl list short sources` and routes via `PULSE_SOURCE`, with the name-based search retained as a fallback when `pactl` is absent.

### Frontend CI
- First PR-time quality gate ([#418](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/418)) — new `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `bun run typecheck` + `bun run build:web` on every PR. Fixed pre-existing type issues that were being suppressed with `@ts-expect-error`, cleaned up a dep-array typo (`[platform.metadata.isTauricheckOnMountcheckForUpdates]`) in `useAutoUpdater`, and removed 100+ lines of dead `ModelItem` code from `ModelManagement.tsx`.
- Follow-up: widened `apiClient.migrateModels()` return type to include `moved` and `errors` so the storage-change handler typechecks against the real backend response ([#470](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/470)).

### Docs
- Clarified in the Quick Start + README that paralinguistic tags (`[laugh]`, `[sigh]`) only work with Chatterbox Turbo; other engines read them as literal text ([#450](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/450)).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-16

The biggest Voicebox release yet. Three new TTS engines bring the lineup to **seven** — HumeAI TADA, Kokoro 82M, and Qwen CustomVoice join Qwen3-TTS, LuxTTS, Chatterbox Multilingual, and Chatterbox Turbo. GPU support broadens to Intel Arc (XPU) and NVIDIA Blackwell (RTX 50-series), with runtime diagnostics that warn when your PyTorch build doesn't match your GPU. The CUDA backend is now split into independently versioned server and library archives, so upgrading no longer redownloads 4 GB of PyTorch/CUDA DLLs.

This release also marks a big community moment: **13 new contributors** shipped fixes and features in 0.4.0. Thirty-plus bug fixes target the most-reported issues in the tracker — numpy 2.x TTS crashes, Windows background-server reliability, macOS 11 launch failures, audio playback silence, Stories clip-splitting races, history status staleness, and more.

### New TTS Engines

#### HumeAI TADA — Expressive English & Multilingual ([#296](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/296))
- Added `tada-1b` (English) and `tada-3b-ml` (multilingual) backends
- Replaced `descript-audio-codec` with a lightweight DAC shim to cut dependencies
- Switched audio decoding to `soundfile` to sidestep `torchcodec` bundling issues
- Redirected gated Llama tokenizer lookups to an ungated mirror so model loading works out of the box
- Fixed tokenizer patch that was corrupting `AutoTokenizer` for other engines
- Fixed TorchScript error in frozen builds

#### Kokoro 82M — Fast Lightweight TTS ([#325](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/325))
- Added Kokoro 82M engine with a new voice profile type system that distinguishes preset voices from cloned profiles
- Profile grid now handles engine compatibility directly — removed redundant dropdown filtering
- Tightened Kokoro profile handling so preset voices can't be edited like cloned profiles

#### Qwen CustomVoice ([#328](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/328))
- Added `qwen-custom-voice` preset engine backed by Qwen3-TTS
- Enforced preset/profile engine compatibility across the generation flow
- Floating generator now shows all engines instead of silently filtering

### Voice Profile UX

Until 0.4, every engine in Voicebox was a cloning model, so every voice profile was usable with every engine and the profile grid just showed them all. Introducing Kokoro and Qwen CustomVoice — which work from preset voices rather than cloned samples — broke that assumption for the first time. An early cut on `main` filtered the grid by the selected engine, which left users running pre-release builds thinking their cloned voices had vanished whenever they switched to a preset-only engine.

This release ships the resolution before it ever reaches a tagged version:

- **Grey-out instead of filter** — all profiles are always visible; unsupported ones render dimmed with a compatibility hint at the bottom of the grid
- **Auto-switch on selection** — clicking a greyed-out profile selects it AND switches the engine to a compatible one, instead of silently doing nothing
- **Instruct toggle restored for Qwen CustomVoice** — the floating generate box now reveals a delivery-instructions input (tone, emotion, pace) when CustomVoice is selected. Hidden across the board while the new multi-engine lineup was stabilizing because most engines don't honor the kwarg; now conditionally exposed only for the one engine that was actually trained for instruction-based style control
- Supported profiles sort first; the grid scrolls the selected profile into view after engine/sort changes
- Fixed engine desync on tab navigation — the form now initializes its engine from the store
- Fixed the disabled-and-selected card click edge case by bouncing selection to re-trigger the auto-switch
- Cleaned up scroll effect timers (requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout) to prevent stale DOM writes on unmount or rapid selection changes

### GPU & Platform

#### Intel Arc (XPU) Support ([#320](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/320))
- First-class Intel Arc support across all PyTorch-based backends
- Device-aware seeding, XPU detection in the GPU status panel, and setup flow detection
- Reports correct device name and VRAM in settings

#### Blackwell / RTX 50-series Support ([#316](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/316), [#401](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/401))
- Upgraded the CUDA backend from cu126 → cu128 for RTX 50-series support
- Added `sm_120+PTX` to the CUDA build via `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` for forward-compatibility with Blackwell architectures (closes 5 open reports: #386, #395, #396, #399, #400)
- GPU settings UI fixes around install/uninstall state

#### GPU Compatibility Diagnostics ([#367](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/367), adapted)
- New `check_cuda_compatibility()` compares the current device's compute capability against the bundled PyTorch's architecture list
- Health endpoint exposes a `gpu_compatibility_warning` field so the UI can surface mismatches
- Startup logs a `WARN` when the installed PyTorch build doesn't support the detected GPU
- GPU status label shows `[UNSUPPORTED - see logs]` — no more silent "no kernel image" failures

#### Split CUDA Backend ([#298](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/298))
- CUDA backend now ships as two independently versioned archives: a small server binary and a large libs archive (the ~4 GB of PyTorch/CUDA DLLs)
- Upgrading Voicebox no longer redownloads the libs archive when only the server binary changed
- Added `asyncio.Lock` around `download_cuda_binary()` so auto-update and manual download can't race on the same temp file ([#428](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/428))
- Updated `package_cuda.py` for PyInstaller 6.18 onedir layout
- Temp archives are always cleaned up on failure, even when the install aborts mid-extract

### Bug Fixes

#### Critical: TTS Generation
- **numpy 2.x `torch.from_numpy` crash** ([#361](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/361)) — torch compiled against numpy 1.x ABI fails silently when paired with numpy 2.x, causing `RuntimeError: Numpy is not available` / `Unable to create tensor` on every TTS request in bundled macOS Intel / Rosetta builds. Pinned `numpy<2.0` in requirements and added a PyInstaller runtime hook with a `ctypes.memmove` fallback as belt-and-suspenders. Hardened afterward to raise on unknown dtypes instead of silently reinterpreting bytes as float32.

#### Platform Reliability
- **Windows background server** ([#402](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/402)) — "keep server running after close" now actually keeps the server running. The HTTP `/watchdog/disable` request could lose the race against process exit on Windows; added a `.keep-running` sentinel file as a synchronous fallback, with stale-sentinel cleanup on startup to avoid orphan server processes
- **macOS 11 launch crash** ([#424](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/424)) — weak-linked ScreenCaptureKit so the app can launch on macOS < 12.3 instead of crashing at dyld resolution. Gated system audio capture behind a real `sw_vers` version check so unsupported systems cleanly advertise "not available" rather than crashing at runtime
- **macOS Intel (x86_64) setup** ([#416](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/416)) — relaxed `torch>=2.7.0` → `torch>=2.2.0`. PyTorch dropped pre-built x86_64 wheels after 2.2.2, so Intel Mac devs could no longer `pip install`. Now resolves to the latest compatible torch per platform
- **Offline model loading** ([#318](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/318)) — Qwen TTS and Whisper force offline mode when loading cached models, so startup works without network access
- **GUI startup with external server** ([#319](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/319)) — fixed GUI launch when pointed at a remote/external server, and added data refresh on server switch; hardened health validation and error handling
- **Qwen3-TTS cache split on Windows** (adapted from [#218](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/218)) — route `Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained` through `hf_constants.HF_HUB_CACHE` so the speech tokenizer and `preprocessor_config.json` resolve from a single cache root
- **Qwen3-TTS bundling** ([#305](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/305)) — bundle `qwen_tts` source files in the PyInstaller build to fix `inspect.getsource` errors in frozen builds
- **Backend import paths** ([#345](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/345)) — moved lazy imports to top-level with absolute paths to resolve the "Failed to Save" preset error caused by `ModuleNotFoundError` in production builds
- **Effects service import** ([#384](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/384)) — fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` on preset create/update by switching to relative imports (#349)

#### Audio & Playback
- **cpal stream silent playback** ([#405](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/405)) — `cpal::Stream` was dropped on function return immediately after `play()`, causing every playback to fall silent. Now holds the stream until either the buffer drains or the stop flag fires (#404)

#### Stories & History
- **Clip-splitting race** ([#403](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/403)) — rapid double-clicks on split could race through `split_story_item` with inconsistent state. Added `with_for_update()` row locking on the backend and an `isPending` guard on the frontend (#366)
- **History `status` staleness** ([#394](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/394)) — `GET /history/{id}` was hardcoding `status="completed"` regardless of the DB row, breaking any client polling for job completion. Now returns `status`, `error`, `engine`, `model_size`, and `is_favorited` from the actual row
- **"Clear failed" bulk button** ([#412](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/412)) — new `DELETE /history/failed` endpoint and a header strip showing `"N failed generations"` with a Clear button, complementing the per-row trash icon added in #321 (#410)
- **Delete failed generations** ([#321](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/321)) — added a trash icon next to the retry button so failed entries can be cleaned up without having to retry first

#### Security & Safety
- **Voice prompt cache hardening** ([#429](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/429)) — `torch.load(weights_only=True)` on cached voice prompts per PyTorch 2.6 recommendation; replaced string-based SPA path guard with `Path.is_relative_to()` for more robust path-traversal protection

#### Infrastructure & Docker
- **Docker web build** ([#344](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/344)) — include `CHANGELOG.md` in the Docker web build so the in-app changelog page works in Docker deployments
- **Docker numba cache** ([#425](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/425)) — set `NUMBA_CACHE_DIR` in docker-compose so numba can write its JIT cache in container runtime (#308)
- **Relative media paths** ([#332](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/332)) — media paths now stored relative to the configured data dir rather than resolved against CWD, so the data directory is portable between installs

### Developer Tooling

- New `triage-prs` agent skill — encodes the end-to-end PR-speedrun workflow (classification → triage doc → rebase → squash-merge → follow-ups) so future release cycles can reproduce it
- Rewrote the TTS engine guide with the patterns learned from adding TADA and Kokoro
- Added the API refactor plan and CUDA libs addon design doc
- Fixed broken links in the Get Started section ([#332](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/332))

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-17

This release rewrites the backend into a modular architecture, overhauls the settings UI into routed sub-pages, fixes audio player freezing, migrates documentation to Fumadocs, and ships a batch of bug fixes targeting the most-reported issues from the tracker.

The backend's 3,000-line monolith `main.py` has been decomposed into domain routers, a services layer, and a proper database package. A style guide and ruff configuration now enforce consistency. On the frontend, settings have been split into dedicated routed pages with server logs, a changelog viewer, and an about page. The audio player no longer freezes mid-playback, and model loading status is now visible in the UI. Seven user-reported bugs have been fixed, including server crashes during sample uploads, generation list staleness, cryptic error messages, and CUDA support for RTX 50-series GPUs.

### Settings Overhaul ([#294](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/294))
- Split settings into routed sub-tabs: General, Generation, GPU, Logs, Changelog, About
- Added live server log viewer with auto-scroll
- Added in-app changelog page that parses `CHANGELOG.md` at build time
- Added About page with version info, license, and generation folder quick-open
- Extracted reusable `SettingRow` component for consistent setting layouts

### Audio Player Fix ([#293](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/293))
- Fixed audio player freezing during playback
- Improved playback UX with better state management and listener cleanup
- Fixed restart race condition during regeneration
- Added stable keys for audio element re-rendering
- Improved accessibility across player controls

### Backend Refactor ([#285](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/285))
- Extracted all routes from `main.py` into 13 domain routers under `backend/routes/` — `main.py` dropped from ~3,100 lines to ~10
- Moved CRUD and service modules into `backend/services/`, platform detection into `backend/utils/`
- Split monolithic `database.py` into a `database/` package with separate `models`, `session`, `migrations`, and `seed` modules
- Added `backend/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `pyproject.toml` with ruff linting config
- Removed dead code: unused `_get_cuda_dll_excludes`, stale `studio.py`, `example_usage.py`, old `Makefile`
- Deduplicated shared logic across TTS backends into `backends/base.py`
- Improved startup logging with version, platform, data directory, and database stats

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-15

The "it works in dev but not in prod" release. This version fixes a series of PyInstaller bundling issues that prevented model downloading, loading, generation, and progress tracking from working in production builds.

### Model Downloads Now Actually Work

The v0.2.1/v0.2.2 builds could not download or load models that weren't already cached from a dev install. This release fixes the entire chain:

- **Chatterbox, Chatterbox Turbo, and LuxTTS** all download, load, and generate correctly in bundled builds
- **Real-time download progress** — byte-level progress bars now work in production. The root cause: `huggingface_hub` silently disables tqdm progress bars based on logger level, which prevented our progress tracker from receiving byte updates. We now force-enable the internal counter regardless.
- **Fixed Python 3.12.0 `code.replace()` bug** — the macOS build was on Python 3.12.0, which has a [known CPython bug](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/7992) that corrupts bytecode when PyInstaller rewrites code objects. This caused `NameError: name 'obj' is not defined` crashes during scipy/torch imports. Upgraded to Python 3.12.13.

### PyInstaller Fixes

- Collect all `inflect` files — `typeguard`'s `@typechecked` decorator calls `inspect.getsource()` at import time, which needs `.py` source files, not just bytecode. Fixes LuxTTS "could not get source code" error.
- Collect all `perth` files — bundles the pretrained watermark model (`hparams.yaml`, `.pth.tar`) needed by Chatterbox at runtime
- Collect all `piper_phonemize` files — bundles `espeak-ng-data/` (phoneme tables, language dicts) needed by LuxTTS for text-to-phoneme conversion
- Set `ESPEAK_DATA_PATH` in frozen builds so the espeak-ng C library finds the bundled data instead of looking at `/usr/share/espeak-ng-data/`
- Collect all `linacodec` files — fixes `inspect.getsource` error in Vocos codec
- Collect all `zipvoice` files — fixes source code lookup in LuxTTS voice cloning
- Copy metadata for `requests`, `transformers`, `huggingface-hub`, `tokenizers`, `safetensors`, `tqdm` — fixes `importlib.metadata` lookups in frozen binary
- Add hidden imports for `chatterbox`, `chatterbox_turbo`, `luxtts`, `zipvoice` backends
- Add `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` to fix resource_tracker subprocess crash in frozen binary
- `--noconsole` now only applied on Windows — macOS/Linux need stdout/stderr for Tauri sidecar log capture
- Hardened `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` devnull redirect to test writability, not just `None` check

### Updater

- Fixed updater artifact generation with `v1Compatible` for `tauri-action` signature files
- Updated `tauri-action` to v0.6 to fix updater JSON and `.sig` generation

### Other Fixes

- Full traceback logging on all backend model loading errors (was just `str(e)` before)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

- Fix Chatterbox model support in bundled builds
- Fix LuxTTS/ZipVoice support in bundled builds
- Auto-update CUDA binary when app version changes
- CUDA download progress bar
- Fix server process staying alive on macOS (SIGHUP handling, watchdog grace period)
- Hide console window when running CUDA binary on Windows

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-15

Voicebox v0.1.x was a single-engine voice cloning app built around Qwen3-TTS. v0.2.0 is a ground-up rethink: four TTS engines, 23 languages, paralinguistic emotion controls, a post-processing effects pipeline, unlimited generation length, an async generation queue, and support for every major GPU vendor. Plus Docker.

### New TTS Engines

#### Multi-Engine Architecture

Voicebox now runs **four independent TTS engines** behind a thread-safe per-engine backend registry. Switch engines per-generation from a single dropdown — no restart required.

| Engine                      | Languages | Size    | Key Strengths                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Qwen3-TTS 1.7B**          | 10        | ~3.5 GB | Highest quality, delivery instructions        |
| **Qwen3-TTS 0.6B**          | 10        | ~1.2 GB | Lighter, faster variant                       |
| **LuxTTS**                  | English   | ~300 MB | CPU-friendly, 48 kHz output, 150x realtime    |
| **Chatterbox Multilingual** | 23        | ~3.2 GB | Broadest language coverage, zero-shot cloning |
| **Chatterbox Turbo**        | English   | ~1.5 GB | 350M params, low latency, paralinguistic tags |

#### Chatterbox Multilingual — 23 Languages ([#257](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/257))

Zero-shot voice cloning in Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, and Turkish.

#### LuxTTS — Lightweight English TTS ([#254](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/254))

A fast, CPU-friendly English engine. ~300 MB download, 48 kHz output, runs at 150x realtime on CPU.

#### Chatterbox Turbo — Expressive English ([#258](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/258))

A fast 350M-parameter English model with inline paralinguistic tags.

#### Paralinguistic Tags Autocomplete ([#265](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/265))

Type `/` in the text input with Chatterbox Turbo selected to open an autocomplete for **9 expressive tags**: `[laugh]` `[chuckle]` `[gasp]` `[cough]` `[sigh]` `[groan]` `[sniff]` `[shush]` `[clear throat]`

### Generation

#### Unlimited Generation Length — Auto-Chunking ([#266](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/266))

Long text is now automatically split at sentence boundaries, generated per-chunk, and crossfaded back together. Engine-agnostic.

- Auto-chunking limit slider — 100–5,000 chars (default 800)
- Crossfade slider — 0–200ms (default 50ms)
- Max text length raised to 50,000 characters
- Smart splitting respects abbreviations, CJK punctuation, and `[tags]`

#### Asynchronous Generation Queue ([#269](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/269))

Generation is now fully non-blocking. Serial execution queue prevents GPU contention. Real-time SSE status streaming.

#### Generation Versions

Every generation now supports multiple versions with provenance tracking — original, effects versions, takes, source tracking, version pinning in stories, and favorites.

### Post-Processing Effects ([#271](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/271))

A full audio effects system powered by Spotify's `pedalboard` library: Pitch Shift, Reverb, Delay, Chorus/Flanger, Compressor, Gain, High-Pass Filter, Low-Pass Filter. 4 built-in presets, custom presets, per-profile default effects, and live preview.

### Platform Support

- **Windows Support** ([#272](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/272)) — Full Windows support with CUDA GPU detection
- **Linux** ([#262](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/262)) — AMD ROCm, NVIDIA GBM fix, WebKitGTK mic access (build from source)
- **NVIDIA CUDA Backend Swap** ([#252](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/252)) — Download and swap in CUDA backend from within the app
- **Intel Arc (XPU) and DirectML** — PyTorch backend supports Intel Arc and DirectML
- **Docker + Web Deployment** ([#161](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/161)) — 3-stage build, non-root runtime, health checks
- **Whisper Turbo** — Added `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` as a transcription model option

### Model Management ([#268](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/268))

Per-model unload, custom models directory, model folder migration, download cancel/clear UI ([#238](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/238)), restructured settings UI.

### Security & Reliability

- CORS hardening ([#88](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/88))
- Network access toggle ([#133](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/133))
- Offline crash fix ([#152](https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox/pull/152))
